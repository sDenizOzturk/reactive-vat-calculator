# reactive-vat-calculator

According to Google search results, common VAT calculation applications are non-reactive. Those apps expect users to do multiple steps each time, such as:

1. Enter the amount
1. Select the calculation type
1. Select rate
1. Click the 'calculate' button

Using this app, users can make those calculations with only one step:

1. Just enter the amount on the correct input field and the results will be displayed simultaneously.
